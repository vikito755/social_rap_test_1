Working title - school, an open grief to the education system.

Ситемата произвежда доктори, но няма кои да я излекува

First grade in school, it looks real smooth.
You read and write to be the best in the hood.
Seventh grade rolls by and the games are put to rest by a test.


I am walking down the street, it is a dark alley.
At the end of it I see a building looking sturdy


In school there is tension, you won't forget it till' pension.
Did I forget to mention.

Attention students today we will have a test, test tes...

At school there is an intension, everyone feels the tension.
It stays there until pension.

Late at night I am walking through a dark alley.
At the start I see a school and a party.

Fun and games are put to rest by a test. The whole room feels like a panic fest.


It is intense

As a kid I was asked, "What do you want to be?"
Всички знаем, че има само 3 верни отговора нали?
